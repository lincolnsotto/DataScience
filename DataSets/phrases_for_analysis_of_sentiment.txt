Review 1:
“I just wanted to find some really cool new places I’ve never visited before but no luck here. Some of these suggestions are just terrible… I had to laugh! Most suggestions were just your typical big cities, restaurants and bars. Nothing off the beaten path here. I don’t want to go these places for fun. Totally not worth getting this.”

Review 2:
“This was such a beautiful book. I wasn’t even planning any travel when I came across this and just started flipping through the pages. I really like the cover and all the large glossy photographs in this book. John Smith did a wonderful job with the photography. I’ve found a perfect home for this on my coffee table. I’m planning a trip to Paris and Barcelona soon and I know this will come in handy. In the meantime, it’s perfect for assisting this armchair traveler!”

“As a traveler, I really appreciated reading about these great places to visit. The author takes you all over the world. Even with all the free information online these days, I find I’m taking this book with me wherever I go and using it to discover hidden gems.”
